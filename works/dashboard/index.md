SwayPay is a customer relationship management solution for hotels to increase their reach and contact thousands of guests with ease. The dashboard works as a hub, where hoteliers can configure automated campaigns, read and reply guest to reviews and track conversions & traffic. Personalized messages can be sent over multiple channels at the best time predicted by Swaypay AI.

Iâ€™ve been actively working on both design and development of the dashboard as we continue to add new features and improvements to SwayPay.
