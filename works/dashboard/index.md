## SwayPay is customer relationship management solution for hotels to increase their reach and contact the thousands of guests with ease. The dashboard works as a hub, where hoteliers can configure automated campaigns, read and reply guest reviews and track conversions & traffic. Personalized messages can be sent over multiple channels at the best time predicted by Swaypay AI.

I’ve been actively working on both design and development of the dashboard as we continue to add new features and improvements to SwayPay.
