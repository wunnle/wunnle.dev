Savibook is a mobile-friendly web application tailored for hotels, enabling them to effortlessly share exclusive offers with guests under their own branding. Guests benefit from personalized offers, streamlining the booking process. Additionally, Savibook simplifies post-stay feedback collection for hotels, enhancing overall guest satisfaction.

I've been deeply involved in both the design and development of Savibook. Our approach involves constant refinement and enhancement of our product, closely tied to an ongoing feedback dialogue with hotels.
